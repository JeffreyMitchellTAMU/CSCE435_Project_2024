# CSCE 435 Group project

## 0. Group number: 23

## 1. Group members:
1. Jeffrey Mitchell
2. Ren Mai
3. Third
4. Fourth

## 2. Project topic (e.g., parallel sorting algorithms)
This project seeks to both implement and evaluate the similarities and differences between different parallel sorting algorithms with regards to problem size, problem type, and behavior regarding both strong and weak scaling. The parallel sorting algorithms chosen for the scope of this project include the following: bitonic, sample, merge, and radix sort.

### 2a. Brief project description (what algorithms will you be comparing and on what architectures)

- Bitonic Sort:
- Sample Sort:
- Merge Sort:
- Radix Sort:

### 2b. Pseudocode for each parallel algorithm
- For MPI programs, include MPI calls you will use to coordinate between processes
#### Bitonic Sort:

#### Sample Sort:

#### Merge Sort:

#### Radix Sort:


### 2c. Evaluation plan - what and how will you measure and compare
- Input sizes, Input types
- Strong scaling (same problem size, increase number of processors/nodes)
- Weak scaling (increase problem size, increase number of processors)

### How the team will communicate:
- For the sake of this project, the team has decided to go forward with using Slack as main form of communication, with periodic in-person meetings for discussion and implementation of the algorithms at hand.
